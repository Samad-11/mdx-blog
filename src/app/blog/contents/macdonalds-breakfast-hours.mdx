# McDonald's Breakfast Hours: When Does Breakfast End Across the U.S.


## General Breakfast Hours

McDonald’s breakfast hours are generally consistent but can vary based on location. Here’s what you need to know about their typical breakfast service:

### Weekday Breakfast Hours

On weekdays, McDonald's usually starts serving breakfast at 5 AM. Breakfast service generally ends at 10:30 AM, transitioning to lunch. This schedule caters to early risers and those with morning routines that require a quick breakfast.

### Weekend Breakfast Hours

During weekends, many McDonald's locations extend breakfast hours until 11 AM. This change accommodates a more relaxed weekend schedule and provides flexibility for those who prefer a leisurely breakfast.

### Differences by Location

Despite these general hours, breakfast times can vary. Factors influencing these differences include:

- **Regional Preferences:** In major cities like New York and Los Angeles, some locations offer breakfast from 4 AM to 11 AM to meet high demand.
- **Franchise Decisions:** Individual franchisees may adjust hours based on local customer preferences and operational considerations.
